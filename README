Keyboard Toolbar

Keyboard toolbar is a custom class for iOS applications using it user can implement the input control's input accessory view functionality.

When we use multiple text views then we face the problem of hiding the keyboard then we use this custom class to move between them and hide the keyboard.

This class have a toolbar on which I added one segmented control with Previous & next button items to move between the input controls and a button named Done to hide the keyboard.

To implement it in your project you only have to add the Keyboard Toolbar folder to your project which have three files:

KeyboardToolbar.h
KeyboardToolbar.m and
KeyboardToolbar.xib.

Wherever you want to implement it you have to import KeyboardToolbar.h file to that .h file and implement KeyboardToolbarDelegate:

- (void)doneButtonPressed;
- (void)prevButtonPressed;
- (void)nextButtonPressed;

In doneButtonPressed delegate you have to resignFirstResponder the active input control.
In prevButtonPressed delegate you have to implement the move to prev input control funtionality.
In nextButtonPressed delegate you have to implement the move to next input control funtionality.

I implemented the previous and next functionality using the mutable array of input fields and the text views place holder functionality using mutable dictionary.

You can also implement the move of the input fields using animation as I implemented in the sample code using scroll view i moved the input fields with animation.

If you face any difficulty to implement then you can contact me using my personal email address yash.vyas.29@gmail.com.
